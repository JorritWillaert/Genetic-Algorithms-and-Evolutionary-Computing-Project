abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter discusses surface preparation and treatment techniques for adhesive bonding. Preparation prior to adhesive bonding is the basis of successful bonding. Surface preparation, also known as surface pretreatment, is carried out to render adherend surfaces receptive to the development of strong, durable adhesive joints. Proper surface preparation also ensures that the weakest link in an adhesive joint exists within the adhesive or organic material layer and not at its interface within the adherend. Plasma treatment for cleaning of the contaminants and surface modifications are used in various applications. This produces the new functional surfaces, for thermally sensitive substrates can be used for treatment. There are also significant techniques available for the treatment of plastic surfaces to enhance adhesion including corona, flame and plasma treatment, and chemical etching, all of which serve to increase the surface energy of plastics. Furthermore, the effectiveness of surface preparation can be determined by measuring the bond strength and determining the mode of the failure of the adhesive joint.},

abstract = {The science of adhesion is multidisciplinary in scope. Both chemical and physical forces contribute to adhesion and lack of adhesion. It is impossible to understand adhesive forces without an appreciation of both chemical and physical interactions. It is a goal of adhesion research to separate and measure the individual factors which lead to adhesion. This commendable goal has been attempted by some and achieved by few. Two difficulties have always hampered such a correlation. First, it is difficult to develop physical test methods which scientifically measure adhesive forces. Second, it has required decades for the development of analytical techniques which can begin to provide researchers with information about the nature of the chemical and physical forces at work at an interface or in an interphase.},

abstract = {Piezoresistive silicon pressure sensors are widely used in automotive, aerospace and medical equipment industries. Batch bonding of the sensors is limited by the manual manipulation required specially trained technicians. In order to reduce the production costs and simultaneously obtain high production quality, a vision based integrated system for automated anodic bonding is presented. This system consists of a vision subsystem, macro/micro stages, a vacuum micromanipulator, and some additional subsystems. The macro/micro stage performs fine positioning and bonding under the navigation of the vision, the vacuum micromanipulator integrated with smart force sensor can perform highly-precise bonding tasks and a nondestructive transportation of the chip and the quartz base. To perform manipulations automatically, a control system, including a task planning level and a real-time execution level, was developed. The automated batch bonding is validated by further experiment. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

@article{CAD-based_adhesive_spray_shoes,
abstract = {Most shoe manufacturing processes are not yet automated; it puts restrictions on increasing productivity. Among them, adhesive application processes particularly are holding the most workers and working hours. In addition, the working environment is very poor due to the toxicity of adhesive agents. In the case of automating an adhesive application process by using a robot, robot teaching by playback is difficult to produce high productivity because the kinds of shoes to be taught mount up to several thousands. To cope with it, it is necessary to generate robot working paths automatically according to the kind, the size, or the right and the left of shoes, and also to teach the generated paths to a robot automatically. This paper presents a method to generate three-dimensional robot working paths off-line based on CAD data in an automatic adhesive spray system for shoe outsoles and uppers. First, this paper describes how to extract the three-dimensional data of an outsole outline from a two-dimensional CAD drawing file. Second, it describes how to extract the three-dimensional data of an upper profiling line from the three-dimensional scanning data that is opened in a three-dimensional CAD program. Third, it describes how to generate robot working paths based on the extracted data and the nozzle setting parameters for adhesive spray. Also, a series of experiments for adhesive spray is performed to verify the effectiveness of the presented methods. This study will do much for increasing productivity in shoe manufacturing as a core work of a robotic adhesive spray system. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

This result came as a surprise because the main customer industries, automotive and electrical/electronics, had a difficult year and two of the main destinations, China and North America, have been starring in a trade conflict, spreading uncertainty to the global economy. Nevertheless, the automotive industry remains the largest customer industry with 30% of total installations, ahead of electrical/electronics (25%), metal and machinery (10%), plastics and chemical products (5%) and food and beverages (3%).

With a controlled working environment, industrial robots can repeat tasks time after time providing the effective cycle times with an ignorable difference unless the conditions being uncontrollable. In this research work, a set of empirical experimentation is done using a 2k full factorial DOE, with 2 factors affecting 2 responses. The factors are the type and speed of robotic programing termination, while the responses are cycle time and consistency as variables for the effective performance. The analysis shows that the factor FINE (termination type) at 100% (speed) yielded the best results for cycle time and CNT (termination type) at 100% (speed) yielded the best consistency of the robotics program.},

@article{adhesively_bonded_joints_composites,
abstract = {Continuing interest and more developments in recent years indicated that it would be useful to update Banea and da Silva paper entitled “Adhesively bonded joints in composite materials: an overview”. This paper presents an updated review of adhesively bonded joints in composite materials, which covers articles published from 2009 to 2016. The main parameters that affect the performance of bonded joints such as surface treatment, joint configuration, geometric and material parameters, failure mode etc. are discussed. The environmental factors such as pre-bond moisture, moisture and temperature are also discussed in detail and how they affect the durability of adhesive joints. Lots of shortcomings were resolved during the last years by developing new materials, new methods and models. However, there is still a potential to evaluate and identify the best possible combination of parameters which would give the best performance of composite bonded joints.},

@article{advantages_SMPs,
abstract = {Silyl-modified polymers (SMPs) are alkoxysilyl functionalized polymers of high importance both academically and industrially. SMPs are being developed for coating, adhesive, sealant and elastomer applications. In this paper, emphasis is placed first on the different chemical modification approaches available to tackle the synthesis of SMPs by in situ functionalization (ISF) and post-polymerization functionalization (PPF) routes, with their pros and cons being underlined. Recent progress and modern trends towards alkoxysilyl telechelic polyenes and polyolefins by olefin metathesis strategies are next discussed. The state-of-the-art of alkoxysilyl functionalized polymers, especially of telechelic ones, delineated according to the latter two main synthetic pathways, is then covered along with their subsequent curing, and is illustrated by selected examples including, in particular, polyenes, polyolefins and some other selected relevant polymers.},

@article{glue_coating_visual_servo,
abstract = {At present, Glue-coating machines have some shortages, such as unintelligence, complexity of setting glue path for new parts. In this paper, real-time image capture was achieved by using digital camera technology and image processing technology. The captured image is converted into a character vector. Workpiece model is determined through comparing with the standard library and the similarity. The image of workpiece was vectored through frame extracting and fitting. With {NC} (Numerical Control) code generation technology, the {NC} code is automatically generated for sprinkler nozzle walking track. By Appling visual servo and embedding the vision system into feedback loop of the robot, the system achieves high-precision robot control. By extracting the glue line curve from image, thinning glue curve by morphological method, and extracting the frame information, the closure and quality of the glue curve can be detected. Results of test show that the effect is satisfactory and the method is effective.},

@book{polyurethane_elastomers,
abstract = {A comprehensive account of the physical / mechanical behaviour of polyurethanes (PU´s) elastomers, films and blends of variable crystallinity. Aspects covered include the elasticity and inelasticity of amorphous to crystalline PUs, in relation to their sensitivity to chemical and physical structure. A study is made of how aspects of the constitutive responses of PUs vary with composition: the polyaddition procedure, the hard segment, soft segment and chain extender (diols and diamines) are varied systematically in a large number of systems of model and novel crosslinked andthermoplastic PUs. Results will be related to: microstructural changes, on the basis of evidence from x-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS), and also dynamic mechanical analyses (DMA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and IR dichroism. Inelastic effects will be investigated also by including quantitative correlations between the magnitude of the Mullins effect and the fractional energy dissipation by hysteresis under cyclic straining, giving common relations approached by all the materials studied. A major structural feature explored is the relationship between the nature of the hard segment (crystallising or not) and that of the soft segments. Crystallinity has been sometimes observed in the commercial PUs hard phase but this is usually limited to only a few percent for most hard segment structures when solidified from the melt. One particular diisocyanate, 4,4'-dibenzyl diisocyanate (DBDI) that, in the presence of suitable chain extenders ( diols or diamines), gives rise to significant degrees of crystallinity [i-iii] and this is included in the present work. Understanding the reaction pathways involved, in resolving the subtle morphological evolution at the nanometre level, and capturing mathematically the complex, large-deformation nonlinear viscoelastic mechanical behaviour are assumed to bring new important insights in the world basic research in polyurethanes and towards applied industrial research in this area.},

@article{motion_planning_reinforcement_learning,
abstract = {A major challenge of today's production systems in the context of Industry 4.0 and Cyber-Physical Production Systems is to be flexible and adaptive whilst being robust and economically efficient. Specifically, the implementation of motion planning processes for industrial robots need to be refined concerning their variability of the motion task and the ability to adaptively deal with variations in the environment. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based, cognition-enhanced six-axis industrial robot for complex motion planning along continuous trajectories as e.g. needed for welding, gluing or cutting processes in production. Our prototype demonstrator is inspired by the classic wire loop game which involves guiding a metal loop along the path of a curved wire from start to finish while avoiding any contact between the wire and the loop. Our work shows that the RL-agent is capable of learning how to control the robot to successfully play the wire loop game without the need of modeling the wire or programming the robot motion beforehand. Furthermore, the extension of the system by a visual sensor (a camera) allows the agent to sufficiently generalize the learning problem so that it can solve new or reshaped wires without the need of additional learning. We conclude that the applicability of RL for industrial robots and production systems in general provides vast and unexplored potential for processes that feature variability to some extent and thus require a general and robust approach for process automation.},
